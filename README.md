# Enhanced Hello World of Deep Learning

We all know that the 'Hello World of Deep Learning' is training a model that is able to classify digits. But, we developed an enhanced version
wherein we have used the basics of computer vision to develop an interactive digit classifier. This repository consists of implementation
of Artificial Neural Network from scratch in NumPy along with Convolutional Neural Network based models written in frameworks such as 
Keras, TensorFlow and PyTorch (the best). Before making this interactive digit classifier, we made a mouse-pad based digit classifier 
where a digit is drawn with the help of a mouse on the screen and the digit is recognized. 

## Getting Started

The dataset is downloaded directly in the code (using pakages like torchvision). To get a better description of the project, refer this [repository link](https://github.com/sayangoogle/Summer-Project-2019).
The structure of the repository is shown as below

### Prerequisites

I recommend using google colab in order to access these files. There will be no dependency as everything is pre-installed. If you are using
Jupyter Notebook, you have to install the dependencies which are imported in the interactive notebook. 

### Procedure

Clone the repository to your local machine or you can directly access from google colab. Then run the notebooks. There is no need to
seperately download the MNIST dataset as the dataset is automatically downloaded while the notebook is running.
